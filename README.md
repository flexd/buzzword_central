================

Various technologies and other things (buzz!) I've tried or used throughout the years.

Basically just a way for me to keep track of what I've tried before, at some point I might even get around to writing down my experiences with these things too, not likely.


Primary OS: OSX on laptop, debian/ubuntu on servers, I have a few VM's for projects.

Various things I've used. This does not mean I am an expert in any of these, no specific order.
